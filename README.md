# hello-world
It is a small world after all.
I don't have the habit of daily writing and it seems that nothing is left while time is flying.
I have tons of plan but no one has started yet.
Looking at what I worte just now, I find I am not able to orginaze my idea, just writing one sentence after another without coherence.
Github is only a tool which does not gurantee my progress. However, I hope it can.
